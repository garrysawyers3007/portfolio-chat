/**
 * DEPRECATED: Backend Server Not Required
 * 
 * As of the client-side Langchain implementation, this file is no longer needed.
 * Langchain RAG runs entirely in the browser using:
 * - src/services/ragService.js (Langchain chain initialization)
 * - src/services/chatAPIClient.js (Client-side API client)
 * 
 * Just run: npm start
 * 
 * No backend server required! 🎉
